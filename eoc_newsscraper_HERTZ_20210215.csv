Urls,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/bankrupt-hertz-is-a-pandemic-zombie,,“This Is Just F--king Unbelievable!”: Bankrupt Hertz Is a Pandemic Zombie,"The pandemic and its economic consequences have occasioned any number of counterintuitive events in the financial markets. There has been Herbalife’s $600 million junk bond deal that the company used to buy back some of the stock of the company’s largest shareholder, the multibillionaire Carl Icahn. There have been the other billionaires who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars of new equity from investors through SPACs—special purpose acquisition companies—on the whiff of a hope that the money will be invested wisely. There has been Boeing’s much-needed and successful $25 billion capital raise and its decision to fire 10% of its workforce.

Then, in a class of absurdity by itself, is what’s happening at Hertz, the nation’s second-largest car-rental agency. On May 22, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, after the combination of nearly $19 billion of debt and some 700,000 idle rental cars in the midst of a global pandemic left its business in financial tatters. It is one of the largest bankruptcies to result from the pandemic. On May 26, Carl Icahn, Hertz’s largest shareholder—with a nearly 39% stake in the company—sold his 55.3 million shares for an average price of 72 cents a share, generating some $40 million of proceeds and perfecting a loss for him of around $1.8 billion on his Hertz investment. At the time of his stock sale, Icahn said he had faith in Hertz but that the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in an “extremely rapid and substantial decrease in travel” that caused Hertz “major financial difficulties.” Nothing unusual yet: a company weighed down by way too much debt and an exogenous event that ruptures its business files for bankruptcy, followed by its billionaire largest shareholder getting what he can for his soon-to-be-worthless stock.

The weirdness then started in earnest. Between May 26 and June 8, Hertz’s stock—still trading on the New York Stock Exchange during bankruptcy although destined for delisting—exploded in price. During those two weeks the Hertz stock increased to $5.53 per share, from 56 cents per share, a ridiculous and inexplicable rise of nearly 10 times. Sometimes these kinds of crazy things happen to the publicly traded stock of bankrupt companies, where woefully uninformed retail investors—you and me—buy up the stock hoping other fools will too. And sometimes, as in this case, the speculators can make money. The stocks of other newly or near-bankrupt companies—J.C. Penney, Chesapeake Energy—have also rallied in recent weeks. It is all pure gambling. There is no circumstance—zero—where Hertz shareholders will ever get a recovery once a plan of reorganization with creditors is agreed upon, probably months from now.

How do I know? Part of the reason is because I understand corporate restructuring. For nearly five years at Lazard, in the early 1990s, I worked on several of the biggest bankruptcies of the day, among them Revco Drug Stores and Federated Department Stores. What happens 99.9% of the time is that existing shareholders get wiped out and the creditors, most of which won’t get their money back, divide up what’s left of the carcass. It’s often a Darwinian battle of epic proportions, with creditors fighting over every scrap of value. What happens time and time again is that unless and until every creditor gets back every penny it is owed plus accrued interest, there will be no recovery for the shareholders. As in zero.

That’s what is going to happen to Hertz, too, and I know that because the Hertz bonds are trading at a severe discount. As of June 10, according to the Wall Street Journal, Hertz’s nearly $3 billion of unsecured bonds were trading at around 40 cents on the dollar. That means—at the moment, anyway —smart investors do not believe Hertz’s creditors will get their money back. (If they did, the bonds would be trading at 100 cents on the dollar, as they were in February before the lockdowns destroyed Hertz’s business.) If creditors don’t get their money back, there is no way shareholders are going to get any of the remaining crumbs when the restructuring gets agreed upon. It’s just not going to happen. If it were going to happen, there is no way Icahn would have sold his stake in Hertz for an average of 72 cents a share.

And now things at Hertz have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. It’s one thing for speculators to speculate before the existing Hertz shares get delisted, which the New York Stock Exchange has ordered. (In a June 10 public filing, Hertz said it was appealing the NYSE notice and then admitted, “There can be no assurance that the NYSE will grant the Company’s request for continued listing at the hearing and—my italics—whether there will be equity value in the Company’s common stock.”) It’s quite another for the debtor—Hertz—to take advantage of its own badly misinformed shareholders by attempting to sell them new equity, knowing for sure that stockholders will get wiped out after a plan of reorganization is agreed to, leaving them with nary a sou. It’s easily one of the more cynical financial ploys to come along in a season filled with cynical financial ploys. (And Hertz even admits in its prospectus that the investors in the offering could get wiped out in the bankruptcy.)

But that is exactly what Hertz is attempting to do, with the help of Jefferies, the midsize investment bank that has agreed to underwrite the stock sale. Hertz’s decision lit up Twitter. “This [Hertz] shit gonna go down in the record books,” Roberto Pedone tweeted. “A company in bankruptcy just found idiots to buy their stock before it probably goes to ZERO. Unless some miracle gets pulled off, they just sold you a valueless piece of paper.” Added Nick Verbitsky, in a tweet on June 12, “Hertz stock up 27% today after a ch 11 filing and a massive share offering announced. When the dumb money gets murdered on this, there can be no sympathy.”","Then, in a class of absurdity by itself, is what’s happening at Hertz, the nation’s second-largest car-rental agency.

Urls,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/hertz-jcpenny-j-crew-join-list-businesses-filing-bankruptcy-n1213961,2020-05-24 13:06:00+00:00,"Hertz, JCPenney, JCrew join list of businesses filing bankruptcy","WASHINGTON — When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written, there will be more than a few words devoted to the retailers the virus decimated as it pounded the economy. The last month, in particular, has brought bankruptcies from well-known brands with deep roots around the country. This weekend, Hertz, the rental car giant, joined the list.

But the impacts of the coronavirus are only half the story. In some cases, such as restaurants and travel companies, the virus is undoubtedly the primary cause of trouble, but in others it looks more like an accelerant — gas on a retail fire that has been burning for quite some time.

The last month has been particularly noteworthy. In the space of just two weeks, some of the best-known brands in America declared they were entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closing outlets across the country.

Back on May 4, Gold’s Gym, the national chain of exercise facilities, announced it was headed to Chapter 11, a move affecting roughly 4,000 employees and 700 locations in more than 20 states. The company said it was planning to permanently shutter 30 locations. And J. Crew, the well-known purveyor of preppy attire, also filed for Chapter 11, a move affecting 500 locations and 13,000 employees in 44 states.

On May 7, Neiman Marcus said it was entering Chapter 11, directly affecting roughly 13,000 employees at 68 stores in 18 states. And on May 14, JC Penney, the long-beleaguered legacy retail giant with 850 stores in 49 states said the same thing, a move affecting some 90,000 employees.

Those are some well-known names, but in some ways their bankruptcies may not be shocking. Gyms and clothing stores are exactly the kinds of businesses that the coronavirus lockdown seems designed to damage. Raising one’s heart rate and sweating are at-home activities these days and apparel shopping is done with a few clicks of a mouse.

But even before May, there were signs of trouble for the brick-and-mortar commerce world this year.

Back in mid-February, Pier One entered Chapter 11, a move that affected roughly 970 locations and 18,000 employees scattered around the United States with some in Canada. Art Van Furniture, said it would be shuttering on March 8, affecting 3,000 employees and 169 locations around the Midwest. And on March 11, Modell’s, which claimed to be the oldest sporting goods store in America said it was entering Chapter 11, closing the doors of about 140 locations with 3,600 employees on the East Coast.

And even beyond retail, there were signs of trouble elsewhere in the economy. In January, Bar Louie, the trendy upscale chain of bar/bistros, announced it would begin a bankruptcy restructuring hitting 90 locations and 1,500 employees.

In other words, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, there were signs that 2020 might not be shaping up to be a great year for merchants with real-world physical locations. Part of that may have been economic exhaustion. The post-Great Recession expansion had been unfolding for more than 10 years (since 2009) when 2020 arrived. Some retrenching may have been inevitable.

But on the retail side there was also the steady march of e-commerce, which has been battering brick-and-mortar stores especially hard for a decade now. Consider the numbers from recent years.

In 2018, retailers closed nearly 6,000 brick-and-mortar locations permanently, according to Coresight Research. In 2019, the figure was even higher, 9,300 locations were shuttered. And, of course, all of those closures had nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic.

For months now, much of the COVID conversation has centered on how the pandemic might change the nation. How deep will the changes be? What will the post-pandemic United States look like, particularly economically?

But even before the virus, the nation and its economy were going through major changes. Keep in mind all those closures in 2018 and 2019 came as the economy was booming.

There is no question that the coronavirus is hammering the U.S. economy and that it is taking a toll on some healthy businesses and employers. But the biggest economic impact from COVID-19 may be that it is pushing the economy into the future much faster than before, striking hard at businesses that were already weak from other challenges.

It all serves as a reminder that even after the pandemic is controlled, the road “back to normal” is not going to be easy, and “normal” may look very different.","In the space of just two weeks, some of the best-known brands in America declared they were entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closing outlets across the country.

Urls,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy/index.html,2020-05-22 00:00:00,Hertz files for bankruptcy,"The company has been renting cars since 1918, when it set up shop with a dozen Ford Model Ts, and has survived the Great Depression, the virtual halt of US auto production during World War II and numerous oil price shocks. By declaring bankruptcy, Hertz says it intends to stay in business while restructuring its debts and emerging a financially healthier company.

""The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company's revenue and future bookings,"" said the company's statement. It said while it too immediate action in response to the crisis, ""uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today's action.""

The filing is arguably the highest-profile bankruptcy of the Covid-19 crisis, which has prompted bankruptcies by national retailers like JCPenney Neiman Marcus and J.Crew , along with some energy companies such as Whiting Petroleum and Diamond Offshore Drilling . But none of the companies to file so far have had such as large a share of their industry as does Hertz, which along with rivalsand privately held Enterprise dominate the rental car industry

General Motors GM A bankruptcy filing does not mean a company will be forced out of business. Many companies have gone through the process and gone on to post record profits, including automakerand many of the nation's airlines. But many companies that have filed for bankruptcy with the intention of staying in business have not survived the process.

Hertz said the bankruptcy process will give it ""a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.""

Deep cuts already in place

The company rents cars under the brands Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly, a discount brand outside the United States.

The company has already made deep cuts to stem its losses. It has notified 12,000 employees in North America that that they were losing their jobs, and another 4,000 are on furloughs. Its US workforce stood at 38,000 employees at the start of the year, with about a quarter of them represented by unions.

Hertz HTZ shares closed down 7.5% on Friday and have fallen 82% so far this year. Shares moved sharply lower in after-hours trading Friday evening. Shares are likely to become worthless as part of the bankruptcy process.

Hertz missed an April 27 payment that was owed to a group of lenders that lease vehicles in Hertz's day-to-day US rental fleet. The lenders extended a grace period for the payment until May 22 ""to engage in discussions ... with the goal to develop a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact of the Covid-19 global pandemic and Hertz' ongoing operating and financing requirements.""

The company had a total of 568,000 vehicles and 12,400 corporate and franchise locations worldwide at the start of this year. About a third of those locations are at airports.

A significant portion of Hertz's nonairport business is renting cars to people who are having their vehicles repaired after accidents. But with so many people out of work or working from home, the miles being driven and the number of car accidents are down significantly. Car insurers are voluntarily returning more than $7 billion, or between 15% to 25% of premiums, to their customers.

Mounting losses and debt

Avis Budget Group CAR Hertz posted annual revenue of $9.8 billion last year, a company record, and its rental car revenue is comparable to that of rival. But Hertz has problems that predate the Covid-19 pandemic. It posted a $58 million net loss in 2019, down from a $225 million loss in 2018. But in the first three of this year it lost $356 million.

Hertz had $18.8 billion of debt on its books as of March 31, up $1.7 billion from the end of last year. Most of that debt, $14.4 billion, is backed by its vehicles. That includes the debt for which it missed the payment in April the prompted this latest crisis. It had only $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the end of March,

A storied history

Hertz was founded in Chicago just more than a century ago by Walter Jacobs, who sold the company in 1923 to John Hertz, who renamed it and expanded the fleet to 600 cars. He began the nation's first national rental network in 1925 and opened its first airport location at Chicago Midway Airport in 1932.

United Airlines UAL Ford F Hertz has had a number of high-profile corporate owners, including RCA,, and most recently, which sold it to a group of private equity firms in 2005 for $5.6 billion. It was taken public a year later.

Its primary shareholder today is activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 38% of its shares outstanding. He continued to increase his stake in the company all the way through mid-March. Those shares, which increased the size of his stake by 26%, have lost more than 60% of their value in the two months since his most recent purchases.

The problems at Hertz and the rental car business overall are particularly bad news for the world's automakers. Rental car companies are traditionally a major purchaser of new cars. Last year they purchased 1.7 million US cars, according to Cox Automotive. That equaled to 10% of US new car purchases.

Hertz had already announced it would not purchase any new cars for the rest of this year, and that it is starting to sell its vehicles as used cars. As of early March, it had sold 41,000 cars out of its US fleet and another 13,000 out of its European fleet. But a halt of used car auctions and the closure of many used and new car dealerships has brought sales to a virtual halt.

But it is clear that as used car sales channels return to normal, rental car companies will continue to slash the size of their fleets. Avis Budget said it expects its fleet in the Americas will be reduced by 20% by the end of June, compared to a year earlier.","By declaring bankruptcy, Hertz says it intends to stay in business while restructuring its debts and emerging a financially healthier company.
